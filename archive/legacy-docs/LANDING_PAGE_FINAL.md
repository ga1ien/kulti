## VALUE PROP (3 Cards)

### Multi-Person Sessions

Not one person streaming to thousands.
4-6 people building together.

Pass screen control back and forth.
Like pair programming, but everyone's invited.
```

### Zero Setup
```
Click. You're live.

No OBS. No fancy mic. Camera optional.
Just open the app and start building.
```

### Learn By Doing
```
Stuck on a bug? Someone's been there.
Building something new? Get real-time feedback.

Stop watching tutorials. Start building with people.
```

```
