### Files Created/Modified

```
/app/api/hms/start-recording/route.ts (existing, verified)
/app/api/hms/stop-recording/route.ts (existing, verified)
/app/api/recordings/list/route.ts (new)
/app/api/recordings/[recordingId]/route.ts (existing)

/supabase/migrations/20251111183934_recordings.sql (existing)
/Docs/RECORDING_SYSTEM.md (new)
```

### Recording Flow

1. Host starts recording → API creates record (status: "recording")
2. HMS begins recording → Webhook updates status
3. Host stops recording → API updates status ("processing")
4. HMS processes recording → Webhook fires when complete
5. Webhook updates with URL and duration → Status: "completed"
6. Users can view/download recording
7. Host can delete recording if needed

### Next Steps

1. Test recording end-to-end in production
2. Configure HMS webhooks with production URL
3. Monitor recording success rate
4. Consider adding recordings UI page (Phase 2 feature)
