## "Vibe Coding" Movement

### Origin

The term "vibe coding" was coined by **Andrej Karpathy** (former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI founding member) in early 2024, describing a new approach to development:

> "The new workflow: describe what you want to the AI, watch it write the code, iterate by talking to it. Vibe-based development."

### Characteristics of Vibe Coders

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **AI-first** | Use AI tools as primary coding interface |
| **Experimental** | Iterate rapidly, embrace failure |
| **Public** | Build in public, share process not just results |
| **Collaborative** | Prefer pair programming and group sessions |
| **Learning-oriented** | Constantly acquiring new skills |
| **Community-driven** | Value peer feedback and connection |

### Growth Indicators

- Cursor (AI code editor): **$500M+ valuation**, rapid adoption
- Claude Code: Launched 2024, growing developer usage
- GitHub Copilot: **1.8 million paid subscribers** (2024)
- Replit: From **$10M to $100M ARR in 5.5 months** (AI features)
- "vibe coding" searches: **400%+ growth** since term coined
