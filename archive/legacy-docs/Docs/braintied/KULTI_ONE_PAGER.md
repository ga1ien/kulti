# Kulti

## Build Together, Live.

**A Braintied AI Studio Product**

---

### What It Is

Kulti is a live collaborative streaming platform where developers build software together in real-time. Unlike gaming-focused Twitch or production-heavy YouTube Live, Kulti is purpose-built for raw, authentic coding sessions.

---

### The Problem

- **27 million+ developers worldwide** build in isolation
- Twitch is for gaming; YouTube requires polish
- No platform exists for collaborative, public coding sessions
- AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code created a new generation of builders with no dedicated home

---

### The Solution

**Real-time video sessions with turn-based screen sharing, zero setup required, and built-in AI assistance.**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Zero Setup** | Go live in seconds—no OBS, no gear |
| **Screen Pass-Through** | Hand off screen control, not just viewing |
| **Built-in AI** | Claude assistant available in every session |
| **Smart Matchmaking** | Find compatible builders automatically |
| **Massive Scale** | WebRTC for small groups, HLS for 1000+ viewers |

---

### Market Opportunity

- Future: Premium subscriptions, credit purchases, creator monetization

**Network Effects:**
- Matchmaking creates connections
- Referral system drives viral growth
- Community rooms build retention

### Competitive Position
