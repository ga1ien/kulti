 Parallel Execution Strategy

 Week 1 (Days 1-2):
 - Run Workstreams A + B in parallel (both frontend-only)
 - Then run Workstreams C + D + E in parallel (3 agents)

 Week 2 (Days 3-5):
 - Run Workstreams F + G in parallel
 - Optional: Start Workstream H if job board is confirmed

 Dependency Graph

 Independent (can run in parallel):
 - A (Session Integration)
 - B (Topic Voting)
 - C (Notifications)
 - D (Admin Dashboard)
 - E (Settings)

 Dependent (need A+B+C done first):
 - F (Search) - needs all features complete to search them
 - G (Onboarding) - needs features complete to tour them

 Future:
 - H (Job Board) - independent, can start anytime
 - I (Analytics) - needs session/credits data flowing

 Success Criteria

 ✅ All features in database have UI components
 ✅ No orphaned API endpoints without UI
 ✅ All integration TODOs from IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md resolved
 ✅ Admin can manage platform (users, rooms, sessions)
 ✅ Users can configure settings and receive notifications
 ✅ Session room has full feature parity (AI, threads, guests)
 ✅ Community topics are fully interactive with streaming integration
