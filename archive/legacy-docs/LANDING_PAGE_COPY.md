# Kulti Landing Page - Final Copy

**The Definitive, Ready-to-Ship Version**

---

## HERO (Above the Fold)

**Headline:**
```
We're Not A Streaming Platform
```

**Subheadline:**
```
We're the place you wish existed when you were learning to code at 2am
with 47 tabs open and nobody to ask if you're doing it completely wrong.

(You probably were. We all were.)
```

**CTA:**
```
[I Want In]
```

**Visual:** Dark terminal screenshot. Real code visible. Claude chat open. Multiple cursors/names showing collaboration. Raw, not polished.

---

## SECTION 1: The Truth

**Headline:**
```
Here's What Nobody Tells You
```

**Body:**
```
You learned more in one drunk conversation at 1am
than in 6 months of YouTube tutorials.

Because real learning isn't watching someone's perfect take.
It's watching them fuck up, backtrack, Google the same thing
three times, and finally figure it out.

That's what this is.
```

---

## SECTION 2: What This Actually Is

**Headline:**
```
It's Not Complicated
```

**Three Features as Moments:**

### 1. Everyone Gets The Mic
```
Not a stage with an audience. A table with chairs.

You share your screen. Ten minutes later, someone else shares theirs.
Back and forth. Actual collaboration.
```

### 2. Zero Setup
```
Click. You're live. That's it.

No OBS. No "let me adjust my audio" for 15 minutes.
Your camera can stay off. We don't care what you look like.
```

### 3. Small Rooms
```
4-6 people max per session.
Not trying to go viral. Not trying to scale.

Build your weird little corner of the internet.
Invite who you want. Keep it tight.
```

---

## SECTION 3: When You'll Use This

**Headline:**
```
Real Moments
```

**Four Quick Scenarios (Visual Cards):**

### Tuesday, 11pm
```
Stuck on a bug for 3 hours.
Stack Overflow has 6 answers, all from 2019.

Drop into Kulti. Someone's live.
"Yo, can you look at this?"

10 minutes later, bug fixed.
You stay because their project is interesting.
```

### Learning in Public
```
Building your first Next.js app.
You know it's probably wrong.

Stream it. Three people join.
One's been using Next.js for years.
They show you a better way.

45 minutes > week of tutorials.
```

### The 4am Grind
```
Can't sleep. Might as well build.

Go live. Nobody's there.
20 minutes in, someone from Tokyo joins.

Don't even talk for the first hour.
Just two people, same vibe.

Sometimes that's all you need.
```

### Your Crew
```
Every Thursday. Same 5 people.

You call it "office hours" but it's really
just your internet friends working together.

One week you help them.
Next week they help you.
```

---

## SECTION 4: FAQ (Conversational)

**Headline:**
```
Questions You'll Probably Ask
```

### Is this just Twitch for nerds?
```
No. Twitch is one person broadcasting to thousands.
This is 4-6 people actually building together.

Twitch = performance art
Kulti = coworking space
```

### What if I'm not good enough?
```
Perfect. You're exactly who this is for.

Everyone's figuring it out.
You're just doing it with witnesses.
```

### Do I need a fancy setup?
```
Laptop. Internet. That's it.

Your camera can be off the entire time.
This isn't about looking good.
```

### When does this launch?
```
December 2025.

We're building it in public.
You can watch us code this platform on the platform.
```

## SECTION 5: Waitlist

**Headline:**
```
We're Not For Everyone
```

**Subheadline:**
```
If you just want to watch, stay on YouTube.
If you want to build with people who actually get it, you're in the right place.
```

**Form Intro:**
```
We're looking for:
→ People actually building something
→ People who'll show up and contribute
→ People who get that messy > perfect
```

**Form Fields:**
```
Email: your@email.com
Name: What we call you
Twitter (optional): @yourhandle
Why you: Make it count.
```

**Submit:**
```

```

## SECTION 6: Final CTA

**Headline:**
```
So. You Building Or What?
```

**Body:**
```
This isn't for everyone.

But if you've ever:
→ Wished you could just show someone your screen
→ Learned more in 10 minutes of conversation than 3 hours of tutorials
→ Been stuck at 2am with nobody to ask

Then this is probably for you.

We're building it now.
You can either watch from the sidelines, or you can be part of it.

Your call.
```

**CTA:**
```
[I Want In]
```

## SOCIAL COPY

### Twitter Bio
```
Multi-player mode for building stuff
Live streaming without the performance
Invite-only beta → kulti.club
```

### Launch Tweet
```
We built something.

It's called Kulti.

Live streaming for people who build stuff.
Not like Twitch. Not like YouTube.

Actually collaborative. Actually useful.

4-6 people. Pass the screen. Build together.

Invite-only to start.
→ kulti.club
```

---

## THE ONE-SENTENCE PITCH

When someone asks "What's Kulti?":

```
Multi-player mode for building stuff—like Google Meet meets Twitch,
but nobody's performing and everyone actually helps.
```

---

## VOICE & TONE

### Write like:
- 3am conversation with a friend who gets it
- Confident, not arrogant
- Self-aware, not apologetic
- Human, not corporate

### The Test:
Would you say this out loud without cringing?

### Do:
- Short sentences. Punch.
- "You" and "we" (never "our users")
- Real scenarios over features
- Profanity when genuine

### Don't:
- Corporate buzzwords
- False modesty
- Manufactured FOMO
- Over-explaining
- Begging

## DONE.

This is the copy. Ship it.
