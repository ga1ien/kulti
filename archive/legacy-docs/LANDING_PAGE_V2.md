**Building the Future, Live**

## HERO

**Headline:**
```
This Is How We Build Now
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Live sessions. Real mistakes. Actual breakthroughs.
Watch creators build. Build with creators. Become one.
```

**CTA:**
```
[Join the Movement]
```

**Visual:** Dark. Multiple windows open. Terminal, Claude, browser, design tool. Someone's actual workspace. Raw. In progress. Beautiful chaos.

## THE SHIFT

**Headline:**
```
You Already Watch People Game For Hours

Why Not Watch Them Build The Future?
```

**Body:**
```
Millions watch Twitch streamers play games.
Millions watch YouTube creators live their lives.

But the most creative generation in history
is building alone in silence.

That changes now.
```

---

## WHAT THIS IS

**Headline:**
```
The Live Creative Economy
```

**Three Pillars:**

### Watch
```
Drop into live sessions.
See how real builders think.
Learn by watching actual workflows.

Not polished tutorials.
Raw building in real-time.
```

### Build
```
Go live. Build your thing.
Other builders drop in.
You help each other.

Multi-person sessions.
Pass control back and forth.
Actually collaborate.
```

### Become
```
Your first session, you watch.
Your third session, you're helping.
Your tenth session, you're teaching.

This is how movements form.
```

## WHY NOW

**Headline:**
```
AI Changed Everything
```

**Body:**
```
You're building with Claude.
They're building with ChatGPT.
Someone else is using Cursor.

The tools are collaborative.
The process should be too.

You're not just writing code anymore.
You're orchestrating AI, design, and logic in real-time.

That's worth watching.
That's worth sharing.
That's worth building together.
```

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR

**The Vibe Coder**
```
You build at 2am with lo-fi playing.
Claude in one window, docs in another.
You're creating but it feels lonely.

Kulti is your crew.
```

**The Creative Builder**
```
You're not just a developer.
You're a designer who codes.
A founder who ships.
A creator who builds.

This is your stage.
```

**The Learner**
```
You've watched 100 tutorials.
You still don't know how people actually work.

Watch them work.
Then work with them.
```

**The Movement**
```
You believe building should be social.
Creation should be shared.
The future should be live.

You're already here.
```

---

## HOW IT WORKS

```
Go Live
→ One click. Share your screen. Build.

Invite Your People
→ 4-6 people max. Keep it intimate.

Pass The Screen
→ Multi-person control. Everyone builds.

Build The Future
→ Together. Live. Now.
```

---

## THIS IS A MOVEMENT

**Headline:**
```
We're Not Building A Platform

We're Building A Culture
```

**Body:**
```
Where building alone feels weird.
Where sharing your process is normal.
Where learning happens live, not in edited videos.

Where the best builders aren't the ones with the most followers.
They're the ones who show up, help others, and build in public.

This is the live creative economy.
And you're early.
```

## THE MANIFESTO (Separate Page)

**Headline:**
```
Why We're Building This
```

**Body:**
```
We're the first generation building with AI.
We're the most creative generation in history.
We're building the future.

And we're doing it alone.

That's insane.

Your grandparents built cars together in factories.
Your parents built companies together in offices.
You're building the future alone in your bedroom.

Something's broken.

We watch people game for hours.
We watch people cook, travel, react to videos.
But watching someone actually CREATE something?
Watching them build, struggle, breakthrough?

That doesn't exist yet.

Until now.

This is Kulti.

Not a streaming platform.
Not a tutorial site.
Not a social network.

A movement.

Where building is social.
Where learning is live.
Where the future happens together.

You in?
```

## ONE-LINE PITCH

```
The live streaming platform for people building the future with AI.
```

## CORE BELIEF

```
The most interesting thing happening right now
is people building things with AI.

And nobody's watching.

That's the opportunity.
```
